# Worker Docker Overview

`worker-docker` connects to console over gRPC bidi stream `Connect`, sends a signed hello frame, then sends periodic heartbeat frames and handles command dispatch/result in the same stream.

Required identity:
- `WORKER_ID`
- `WORKER_SECRET`

These values must be copied from the credential file generated by console (`worker-credentials.json` by default).

Capability behavior:
- `worker-docker` hardcodes capability declarations to a single capability: `echo`.
- capability declaration includes `max_inflight=4`.
- when receiving an `echo` command, worker returns the exact input string unchanged.

Defaults:
- Console target: `127.0.0.1:50051`
- Heartbeat interval: `5s`
- Heartbeat jitter: `20%`
