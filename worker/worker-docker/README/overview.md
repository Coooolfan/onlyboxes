# Worker Docker Overview

`worker-docker` connects to console over gRPC bidi stream `Connect`, sends a signed hello frame, then sends periodic heartbeat frames in the same stream.

Required identity:
- `WORKER_ID`
- `WORKER_SECRET`

These values must be copied from the credential file generated by console (`worker-credentials.json` by default).

Defaults:
- Console target: `127.0.0.1:50051`
- Heartbeat interval: `5s`
- Heartbeat jitter: `20%`
