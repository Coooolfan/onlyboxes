# Worker Docker Overview

`worker-docker` connects to console over gRPC bidi stream `Connect`, sends a signed hello frame, then sends periodic heartbeat frames and handles command dispatch/result in the same stream.

Required identity:
- `WORKER_ID`
- `WORKER_SECRET`

These values must be copied from the credential file generated by console (`worker-credentials.json` by default).

Capability behavior:
- `worker-docker` hardcodes capability declarations to `echo` and `pythonExec`.
- each capability declaration includes `max_inflight=4`.
- when receiving an `echo` command, worker returns the exact input string unchanged.
- when receiving a `pythonExec` command, worker expects `payload_json` with `{"code":"..."}` and runs:
  - `docker run --rm --memory 256m --cpus 1.0 --pids-limit 128 python:slim python -c <code>`
- `pythonExec` result always uses JSON payload:
  - `{"output":"...","stderr":"...","exit_code":0}`
- non-zero Python exit code is returned in `exit_code` and does not become command error by itself.

Defaults:
- Console target: `127.0.0.1:50051`
- Heartbeat interval: `5s`
- Heartbeat jitter: `20%`
